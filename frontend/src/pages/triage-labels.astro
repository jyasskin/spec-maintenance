<Layout title="Triage Labels">
    <main>
        <p>
            This summary relies on repository maintainers using a particular set
            of labels to triage issues. These are:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><GhLabel {...ghLabels.urgent} /></dt>
            <dd>
                Needs to be resolved more quickly than other issues. These
                issues and PRs are expected to be resolved within 14 days.
            </dd>
            <dt><GhLabel {...ghLabels.important} /></dt>
            <dd>
                Needs to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe, but not as
                quickly as urgent issues. These issues and PRs are expected to
                be resolved within 3 months.
            </dd>
            <dt><GhLabel {...ghLabels.eventually} /></dt>
            <dd>Doesn't need to be resolved within a particular time limit.</dd>
            <dt><GhLabel {...ghLabels.needsFeedback} /></dt>
            <dd>
                The person who reported the issue needs to answer a question
                before progress can be made. The SLO clock doesn't advance
                between when this label is set and when the reporter replies.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </main>
</Layout>
